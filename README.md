## CODTECH-Task2
## CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS

## Overview
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation analysis on a retail dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. By using clustering techniques, we can group customers into meaningful segments and analyze their characteristics to gain valuable insights that can inform business strategies and marketing efforts.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.
- Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.
- Provide insights that can be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities
The project involves the following key activities:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the retail dataset.
   - Standardize the features to ensure uniformity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform initial data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

3. **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters**:
   - Use the elbow method and silhouette score to find the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Clustering**:
   - Apply K-means clustering to segment the customers.
   - Assign each customer to a cluster.

5. **Segment Analysis**:
   - Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.
   - Interpret the cluster centers to understand the typical profile of each segment.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the customer segments using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
   - Plot the actual vs. predicted values for better understanding of the model's accuracy.

## Technologies Used
The project is implemented using the following technologies and libraries:
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for clustering and evaluation metrics.

## Key Insights
The customer segmentation analysis provides several key insights:
- **Distinct Customer Segments**: Identifies unique customer segments based on age, annual income, and spending score.
- **Segment Characteristics**: Provides detailed characteristics of each segment, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Visual Representations**: Offers visual representations of customer segments, aiding in better understanding and communication of results.
